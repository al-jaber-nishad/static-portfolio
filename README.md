# GitHub Page Deployment

Hey there! ðŸš€ This repository is all about deploying a super cool static webpage using GitHub Pages. Below, I'm gonna spill the beans on exactly how I pulled off this awesome task.

## The Game Plan

So, here's the scoop: we needed to deploy a static webpage and follow some specific rules. Let me break it down for you:

1. **Getting the Web Files:**
   - I used files from my Portfolio website.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - I organized the project like this:
    â€” Project directory
    â€” .html
    â€” css/
    â€” js/
    â€” images/
    â€” fontawesome/

3. **Create a Git Repository:**
- I created a Git repository to track the project's version history.

4. **Initialize Main/Master Branch:**
- Initially, the main/master branch had only a README.md file.

5. **Separate Branches and Commit:**
- I created separate branches for each type of file as follows: html, css, js, images, fontawesome. Then I put the file in the respected branched and the made commit taking screenshot.

6. **Merge Branches to Main/Master:**
- I merged each branch into the main/master branch after successfully completing the work in each branch and then removed the branch.

7. **Linear Commit History:**
 - I ensured that the main/master branch had a linear commit history for better clarity and organization.

8. **GitHub Pages Deployment:**
 - I deployed the contents of the main branch using GitHub Pages, making the static webpage accessible online.
